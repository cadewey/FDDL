Installation Instructions
*************************

The following six steps are used to install the FDDL library necessary for
the ITVal program to run.

Step 1. Create a build directory inside the FDDL directory by typing 
	"mkdir build".
Step 2. Enter the build directory by typing "cd build".
Step 3. Type "cmake ..".
Step 4. Type "make".
Step 5. Become the superuser.
Step 6. Run "make install".

By default, the "FDDL" library files will be installed to /usr/local/lib.
Make sure your environment settings (i.e. your PATH variable reflect these 
locations.

To change where the files are installed, this can be 
done during step 3 using the command:

	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=location_for_installation ..
